# Comparision of Machine Learning Algorithms for Raisin Classification Project üçá

This project explores the application of various machine learning algorithms for predicting the class of raisins based on their features. The dataset used contains information such as area, major axis length, minor axis length, eccentricity, convex area, extent, and perimeter.

## Overview üöÄ

The project involves the following steps:

1. **Data Loading and Exploration:**
   - The dataset is loaded from an Excel file using Pandas.
   - Basic exploratory data analysis is performed, including checking for missing values and displaying the dataset's structure.

2. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - The dataset is preprocessed to handle missing values and convert categorical labels into numeric form.
   - Feature scaling is applied to standardize the feature values.

3. **Data Visualization:**
   - Data visualization is crucial for understanding the relationships between different features.
   - Scatter plots and heatmaps are generated using Seaborn to visualize patterns and correlations in the data.

4. **Model Training and Evaluation:**
   - Multiple machine learning algorithms are explored, including Gaussian Naive Bayes, K-Nearest Neighbors, Support Vector Machine, Random Forest Classifier, Perceptron, Logistic Regression, Decision Tree Classifier, and SVM with PCA.
   - Each algorithm is trained on the dataset, and its performance is evaluated using accuracy scores and other relevant metrics.

5. **Hyperparameter Tuning:**
   - Grid search is applied to find the optimal hyperparameters for some of the models, enhancing their predictive capabilities.

6. **Model Comparison:**
   - The accuracy scores and other metrics of each model are compared to identify the most effective algorithm for this specific raisin classification task.

7. **Conclusion:**
   - A summary of the findings and insights gained from the analysis.
